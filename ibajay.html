            <h1>Ibajay Campus</h1>

             <p>The ASU Ibajay Campus was created in July 1971 as the Ibajay National Agricultural and
                Industrial School by virtue of Republic Act 4486. It was later elevated to Western Aklan
                Polytechnic College on December 1994 through R.A. 7838.
             </p>
             <p>
                The school is situated on a hilly portion of Barangay Colong-colong overlooking the scenic
                Sibuyan Sea and the Ibajay River.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of its 25.286 hectares land area, 2.11 hectares are utilized for building structures and the
                remaining 23.176 are used for school projects.
                It was integrated to the Aklan State University in the early part of 2000 and is now the
                College of Hospitality and Rural Resources Management (ASU-CHARRM).
