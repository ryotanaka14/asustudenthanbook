            <h1>V. STUDENTS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION</h1>
                <h2>Student Defined </h2>
             <p>1. Students are those enrolled in and who are regularly attending an educational instruction of
                secondary or higher level or person engaged in formal study (Education Act of 1982).
            </p>
            <h2>Classification of Students</h2>
            <p>
                1. Students shall be classified as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                a) A regular student is one who is registered for normal academic credits and who
                carries the full load for a given semester under the curriculum in which he/she is
                enrolled including the cases of graduating students who may carry less than the
                full load for purpose of completing the requirements of the curriculum. If a student
                has already finished some of the required courses, the earned credits shall be
                added to the units he/she is actually taking in the computation of his/her load is for
                the purpose of determining the student`s status.
            </p>
            <p>
                b) An irregular student is one who is registered for formal credits but who carries
                less than the full load for a given semester under the curriculum in which he/she is
                enrolled.
            </p>
            <p>
                c) A transfer student is one who comes from another institution where he/she started
                studying for a course and who is now registered in the University after qualifying
                for admission.
            </p>
            <p>
                d) A working student is one who is employed on a full-time/part-time basis in or
                outside the University.
            </p>
            <p>
                e) A special course student is one who is registered in short/opportunity courses for
                duration of six months or less. The work done by this student shall not be given
                any credit; however, this shall be reported either as “Satisfactory” or
                “Unsatisfactory” after the end of the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Students shall also be classified as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                a) A freshman is a student who has not completed the prescribed subjects of the first
                year of his/her curriculum or 25 percent of the total number of units required in
                his/her entire course.
            </p>
            <p>
                b) A sophomore is a student who has prescribed subjects of the first year curricula
                or has earned not less than 25 percent nor more than 50 percent of the total
                number of units required in his entire course.
            </p>
            <p>
                c) A junior is a student who has completed the prescribed subjects of the first two
                years of his/her curriculum or has earned not less than 50 percent nor more than

                e) In course other than four-year curricula, students shall be classified on a similar
                proportional basis. In the case of curricula in which the weight of the subjects are
                not expressed in terms of units, the computation shall be made on the basis of their
                equivalents.
            </p>
            <h2>Residency</h2>
            <p>

                in his/her degree, shall be required to enroll “in residency” for that semester/term.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. A student shall finish the degree within the specified program period (i. e BSA -4
                years). If he/she does not finish the course but qualified to pursue the course, the
                student may be given a grace period of ½ year of the total degree program period (e.g.
                BSA, 4 years, ½ of 4 years) to finish provided he/she has a valid reason.
