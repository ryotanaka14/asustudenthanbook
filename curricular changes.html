            <h4>Dropping of Subject</h4>
             <p>
                1. A student may, with the knowledge of the instructor of the subject and consent of the
                adviser and the Dean, drop a subject by filling in the prescribed form, provided that
                his/her case is not covered by Numbers 2 or 3, VII. Rules on Attendance of Student. If
                the drooping takes place after the midterm examination, the instructor shall state on the
                prescribed form whether the student shall be “dropped” or given the grade of “5.0” on the
                basis of his/her class standing on that subject.

                2. A student who intends to drop a subject shall first notify the instructor concerned as
                reflected by his/her signature on the prescribed form. Then the student adviser shall
                recommend approval of the dropping of the subject to the Dean who shall endorse the
                form to the Office of the Registrar. Any student who does not follow this procedure shall

            <p>
