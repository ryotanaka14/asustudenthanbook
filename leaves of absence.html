            <h1>XIV. LEAVE OF ABSENCE</h1>
            <p>1. Prolonged leave of absence shall require a written permission to the Dean or
                equivalent official, stating the reasons for the leave and shall specify the period
                of the leave, which shall not exceed one academic year. The
                College/School/institute, through the Dean or his authorized representative,
                shall notify the parents or guardians of every student granted leave of absence
                and the Registrar for the amount of money to be refunded to the student, if any.
            </p>
            </p>
                2. Students who withdraw from a College/School/Institute/Center without formal
                leave of absence, may have their registration during that semester curtailed or
                entirely withdrawn. A student who stops for one or more semester, but fails to
                apply for leave of absence, shall be required to reapply for admission.
            </p>
