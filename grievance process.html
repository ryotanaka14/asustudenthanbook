                <h1>III. Grievance Process.</h1>
                <h4>A. Informal Resolution</h4>
                <p>Within 30 days of the allegation, each student who has a grievance shall make a
                    reasonable effort to resolve the matter on an informal basis prior to requesting a
                    grievance hearing:
                </p>
            </p>
                    1. For an academic (grade) grievance, the student shall make an appointment with
                    the faculty against whom he/she has a grievance during the faculty member’s
                    posted office hours or at a mutually-agreed-upon time, in order to discuss the
                    student’s complaint. Should the faculty against whom the student has an academic
                    complaint fail to meet with the student in a timely manner, the student may meet
                    with the dean of Instruction of the faculty member.
                </p>
                    2. For a grievance based on an alleged violation of law, policy, and procedures, the
                    student shall attempt to solve the problem with the person with whom the student
                    has the grievance, that person’s immediate supervisor, or Director of Student
                    Services (or designee).
                    </p>
                <h4>B. Formal Complaint Procedures</h4>
                <p>Any student who believes he/she has a grievance must file an approved grievance
                    complaint form with the Director of Office of Student affairs (or designee). The student
                    may obtain the form from the Office of the Student Affairs.
                    The student must file within 90 days of the incident on which the grievance is based; or
                    after the student knew or should have known of the basis for the grievance, whichever is
                    later. The grievance complaint must be filed whether or not the student has already
                    initiated efforts at informal resolution, if the student wishes the grievance to become
                    official. Failure to file a formal complaint within such ninety (90) day period constitutes
                    waiver of the student’s right to appeal.
                    </p>
                    <h4>1. Filing Complaint</h4>
                    The complaint must include the following:
                    </p>
                        a. The exact nature of the complaint (grounds)
                    </p>
                        b. The specific details of the complaint (e.g., chronology of the event and an explicit
                        description of the alleged violation)
                    </p>
                        c. A description of the informal meeting and attempted resolution, if any
                    </p>
                        d. The specific resolution/remedy sought
                    </p>
                        Complaint should be filed at the Office of Student Affairs address to the Director of
                        Student Affairs.
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. Meeting with Director of Student Affairs (or designee)</h4>
                    <p>The Director of Student Affairs (or designee) shall provide to the person against whom
                        the grievance has been filed a copy of the grievance and a copy of the procedure.
                        The Director of Student Affairs (or designee) will provide the grievant with a written
                        copy of the policy and procedure and answers all questions regarding the policy
                        including the student’s rights and responsibilities in the process of filing a grievance.
                        For academic (grade) grievance, the Director of student Affairs (or designee) will
                        inform the student that a grade change may only be made where there is a finding of
                        fraud, mistake, bad faith or incompetence.
                        The Director of Student Affairs (or designee) shall attempt to reach an informal
                        resolution.
                        </p>
                        <h4>3. Request for Grievance Hearing</h4>
                        <p>If an informal resolution cannot be reached, Director of Student Affairs (or designee)
                            shall make a request for records and documents from the student filing the complaint
                            and forward copies of all documents pertinent to the alleged violation to the Chair of
                            the Grievance Committee and the parties. Documents or accusations not specifically
                            related to the alleged violations shall not be forwarded to the committee or the parties
                        </p>
                            a. For academic (grade) grievance, the Chair shall request records and
                            documents from the faculty member against whom the complaint has been
                            filed.
                        </p>
                            b. For grievance based on an alleged violation of law, policy and procedures, the
                            Chair shall request records and documents from the party against whom the
                            complaint has been filed.
                        </p>
                            The Grievance Hearing timeline may be tolled (postponed) pending a formal
                            investigation of any discrimination claims by or against the student. Such investigation
                            must be concluded no later than 90 calendar days as required by law.
                        </p>
                        <h4>4. Grievance Hearing Committee</h4>
                        <p>Within 90 days following receipt of the grievance complaint form, the Grievance
                            Hearing Committee shall conduct a hearing. The following University Grievance
                            Committee members shall be appointed for a term of one academic year as follows:
                            </p>

                            b. One faculty member (and one alternate) and the Faculty President;
                        </p>
                            c. One administrator (and one alternate) appointed by the University President;
                        </p>
                            d. One student (and one alternate) and President of Student Organization.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Additional committee member:</h4>
                        <p>e. For academic (grade) grievances, one faculty member (and one alternate) and

                            f. For other grievances, one classified employee (and one alternate).
                        </p>
                            A committee member shall withdraw from participation in the hearing if a conflict of
                            interest is anticipated, in which case the alternate member shall serve. The members
                            of the Committee shall be provided with the copy of the grievance and any written
                            response provided by the respondent before the hearing begins. Four-fifths of the
                            members of the committee shall be present in order for the committee to act.
                            </p>
                            <h4>5. Hearing Procedure</h4>
                            <p>a. The VPAA (for academic (grades) grievance) / VP Administration (for other
                                grievance), as Chair, shall provide written notice, including the date, time and
                                place of the hearing to both parties at least ten days prior to the hearing. The
                                notice shall be hand-delivered or sent by certified mail and shall include a copy
                                of the complaint.
                            </p>
                        </p>
                                b. The Chair shall provide the involved complainant with a written summary of
                                rights he/she may be entitled to by law or contract at least 10 days before the
                                hearing. For academic (grade) grievance, the Chair of the Committee shall
                                provide the involved faculty member with a written summary of rights he/she
                                may be entitled to by law or contract at least 10 days before the hearing. Both
                                parties shall be given adequate time (at least 10 days) to read and preview all
                                documents, consistent with privacy laws. The right may be waived by either
                                party. Both parties shall be informed that all relevant evidence presented to the
                                hearing committee, whether written or oral, may be used against them in this or
                                any other proceeding unless otherwise prohibited by law. The written notice
                                shall inform the parties of this fact. The Chair of the committee shall inform both
                                parties orally of this fact at the commencement of the hearing.
                            </p>
                                c. The decision of the Chair shall be final on all matters relating to the conduct of
                                the hearing unless there is a vote by a majority of the other members of the
                                panel to the contrary. The Chair may do whatever is necessary, so long as it is
                                legally permissible, to ensure that the hearing is conducted in a fair, dignified
                                and orderly manner.
                            </p>
                                d. The Chair of the committee may exclude a witness from the hearing when the
                                witness is not giving testimony.
                            </p>
                                e. Anyone who disrupts the proceeding or interferes shall be excluded from the
                                proceeding.
                            </p>
                                f. All information derived from the complaint is confidential. Information may not
                                be made public nor discussed with anyone except those with a legitimate need
                                to know.
                            </p>
                                g. The hearing shall be open only to persons directly involved in the matters to be
                                heard. The bargaining agent representing the respondent may send an
                                observer to any hearing.
                            </p>
                                h. The committee may call in “expert witnesses” if the subject of the grievance is
                                beyond their expertise.
                            </p>
                                i. The committee shall inform the witnesses (other than the accused) in writing
                                that they are sought for interview purposes and their participation in the process
                                is requested by the committee. Witnesses shall also be informed as to the
                                purpose of the interview, the general subject of the interview, and their right to
                                request representation by anyone of their choosing prior to and during said
                                interview.
                            </p>
                                j. Any member of the committee may ask questions of any witness.
                            </p>
                                k. The hearing shall be conducted to bring all of the relevant information and
                                evidence to the members of the committee in an orderly and intelligible form.
                                Formal rules of evidence shall not apply. Any relevant evidence shall be
                                admitted, if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are
                                accustomed to relying upon the conduct of serious affairs. Accusations not
                                specifically related to the alleged violation shall not be considered relevant. The
                                rules of privilege shall apply to the same extent that they are recognized in civil
                                actions.
                            </p>
                                l. At all steps of the process, both the student filing and other party have the right
                                to be accompanied, advised and represented by a person or counsel of their
                                choosing. If either party wishes to be represented by an attorney, a request must
                                be represented not less than 10 days prior to the date of hearing. If the student
                                is permitted to be represented by an attorney, the college representative may
                                request legal assistance. The hearing committee may also request legal
                                assistance; any legal advisor provided to the panel may sit with it in an advisory
                                capacity to provide counsel but shall not be a member of the panel nor vote with
                                it.
                            </p>
                                m. If the respondent on his/her representative, or both, are absent from all part of
                                the hearing, the committee shall make its recommendations on the basis of
                                whatever evidence is submitted before the hearing and on whatever evidence
                                and testimony is presented to the committee during the hearing.
                            </p>
                                n. The committee shall make all evidence, written or oral, part of the record.
                            </p>
                                o. The committee shall judge the relevancy and weight of testimony and evidence
                                and make its findings of fact, limiting its investigation to the formal charge. The
                                decision shall be based only on the record of the hearing, and not on matter
                                outside of that record.
                            </p>
                                p. The burden shall be on the grievant to prove by a preponderance of the
                                evidence that the facts alleged are true and a grievance has been sufficiently
                                established.
                            </p>
                                q. The hearing date may be postponed or continued at the discretion of the Chair
                                of the committee. Both parties shall be given notice of the new or continued
                                hearing date.
                            </p>
                                r. The votes of the majority of the members present (at least 3 votes) are
                                necessary in order for the committee to make a recommendation to the Director
                                of Student Services.
                            </p>
                                s. The Chair of the committee shall notify the Director of Student Services of the
                                committee’s recommendation within 10 days.
                            </p>
                                t. A summary record of the proceedings held in a closed session shall be kept in
                                a confidential file by the Director of Student Services and shall be available at
                                all times to the accused person. The Director of Student Services has the
                                responsibility to ensure that a proper record is maintained and available at all
                                times.</p>
                                <h4>6. Final Decision by Director of Student Affairs</h4>
                                <p>Based on the grievance hearing committee’s recommendations, the Director of Student
                                    Services (or designee) may accept the recommendation, return it to the committee for further
                                    review, or reject it. Within 10 days of receipt of the committee’s recommendation, the Director
                                    of Student Services (or designee) shall send written notification to the parties and committee
                                    informing them of:
                                    </p>
                                </p>
                                    a. The committee’s recommendation;
                                </p>
                                    b. The final decision by Director of Student Services; and
                                </p>
                                    c. Appeals procedure
                                     Any decision to reject findings of the committee must be supported by a
                                    summary finding of fact. The decision to recommend a grade change must be
                                    supported by a summary finding of fact, establishing mistake, fraud, bad faith or
                                    incompetence.</p>
                                    <h4>7. Appeals</h4>
                                    <p>a. University President’s Decision
                                        The Director of Office of Student Affairs (or designee) decision may be appealed by
                                        either party in writing within 10 days of the Vice President of Academic Affairs (or
                                        designee) decision.
                                        The University President shall issue a written decision to the parties and their
                                        representatives within ten (10) days of receipt of the appeal. A decision to change a
                                        grade must be supported by a summary finding of fact, establishing mistake, fraud, bad
                                        faith, or incompetence.
                                    </p>
                                </p>
                                        b. BOR’s Decision
                                        The University President’s decision may be appealed to the BOR in writing within 10
                                        days of receipt of the decision.
                                        The Board will review the documentation of the prior steps of the case and determine
                                        whether to confirm the University President’s decision or hear the appeal. If the Board
                                        confirms the University President’s Decision, the appellant has exhausted his or her
                                        remedies. If the Board decides to consider the appeal, it will do so in closed session, and
                                        will issue a final decision within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the decision.
                                        A decision to change a grade must be supported by a summary finding of fact,
                                        establishing mistake, fraud, bad faith or incompetence. Implementation of any grade
                                        change shall be held in abeyance until the internal appeal process has been exhausted.
                                        </p>
