            <h1>VII. CLASS ATTENDANCE</h1>
             <p>Attendance of students to class shall be governed by the rules and regulations
                promulgated by the University.
            </p>
            <p>1. The following rules on attendance shall apply to all
                Colleges/Schools/Institution/Center, in the University.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                a) Any student who, for unavoidable circumstances, is obliged to be absent from
                class, must obtain a written excuse from the office of student Affairs (OSA) to
                be presented to the instructor (s) concerned not later than the second session
                of the class after the date of the student’s return.
        </p>
        <p>
                b) Any medical certificate must be secured from a duly licensed physician.
            </p>
            <p>
                c) An excuse is for the time missed only. The student concerned shall be
                responsible for all the lessons covered by the class during his/her absence and
                all work assigned to be accomplished during such absence shall be made up
                by him/her to the satisfaction of his/her instructor within a reasonable time.
            </p>
            <p>
                d) Whenever a student has been absent for three consecutive class meetings, a
                report thereof should be sent by the faculty member concerned to the Office of
                Student Affairs and the Academic Head of the Students. The Office of Student
                Affairs shall call the student and notify the parents, if necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Where the number of hours lost by absence of a student reaches 20 percent of the
                hours of recitation, lecture, laboratory, or any other scheduled work in one subject,
                he/she shall be dropped from the subject; provided, that a faculty may prescribe a
                longer attendance requirement to meet their special needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. If the majority of the absences are excused, the student shall not be given a grade of
                “5” upon being thus dropped, but if the majority of the absences are not excused,
            </p>
            <p>
                he/she shall be given a grade of “5” upon being thus dropped. Time lost by late
                enrolment shall be considered as time lost by absence.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Three tardy arrivals shall be equivalent to one-hour period absence. Tardy arrival is
                recorded when a student arrives in class after the instructor has called the roll.
                Absence is non-appearance of the student for the entire class period.
            </p>
