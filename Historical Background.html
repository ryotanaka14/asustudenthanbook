     <h1>Historical Background</h1>

     <p>The Aklan State University (ASU) is considered as one of the oldest institutions of learning
        in Western Visayas. It started when the Banga Intermediate School was converted into the Capiz
        Farm School in 1917 through a resolution passed by the Provincial Board headed by Simeon
        Mobo Reyes, Aklan being a part of Capiz then. It was formally opened in June 1918.
        As the enrolment increased considerably, the school was converted in 1928 into a
        secondary rural school and was named the Banga Rural High School.</p>

        <p>
        Through Republic Act No. 3439 authored by Congressman Jose B. Legaspi, the Banga
        Rural High School was named the Aklan Agricultural College (AAC) in 1963. A two-year technical
        course was first offered. Subsequently, the college was permitted on May 19, 1966 to offer
        Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA) program, with Agronomy and Animal Husbandry as
        major fields. </p>

        <p>
        In the seventies, the College further strengthened its instruction program and continued
        to expand its higher education services by offering other baccalaureate courses. In addition, it
        offered graduate and post graduate programs to cater to the needs of professionals who seek for
        career and intellectual advancement.
        Having met the standards and requirements of an agricultural state college, the Aklan
        Agricultural College was converted into the Aklan State College of Agriculture (ASCA) on April
        10, 1992 by virtue of Republic Act No. 7371 which was sponsored by Congressman Ramon B.
        Legaspi.</p>

        <p>
        Pursuant to pertinent provisions of R.A. 7722, and R.A. 8292 as well as R.A. 8745 or the
        General Appropriations Act of 1999, four (4) CHED-supervised institutions were integrated to
        ASCA in 1999. These were the Roxas Memorial College of Arts and Trades (RMCAT) in Kalibo;
        the Aklan National College of Fisheries (ANCF) in New Washington; the Northern Panay
        Teachers College (NPTC) in Makato; and the Western Aklan Polytechnic College (WAPC) in
        Ibajay.</p>

        <p>
        But better are yet to come for ASCA. The consolidated version of House Bill 1548
        authored by Congressman Allen S. Quimpo and Senate Bill 2236 were passed on final reading
        on February 5, 2001 and January 29, 2001, respectively, and on April 4, 2001, R.A. 9055 entitled
        “An Act Converting the Aklan State College of Agriculture in the Municipality of Banga, Province
        of Aklan into a State University to be known as the Aklan State University, appropriating Funds
        Therefor and for Other Purposes” was finally signed into law by President Gloria MacapagalArroyo which elevated the former ASCA to Aklan State University (ASU).
        Today, the School where “boys love to work, and pretty girl sing, cook and dance” has
        gone a long way from its obscurity in the good old days to its present national prominence.</p>
