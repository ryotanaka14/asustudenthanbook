                of each term in accordance with the prescribed grading system.
            </p>
        </p>
                2. The grading system shall be uniform, using number grades in multiples of .25
                from 1 to 5, where 1 is the highest and 3 as the lowest passing grade. No grade
                of 4 shall be given as final rating.
            </p>
            3. A student who has received a passing grade in a given course shall not be
            allowed to re-examination for the purpose of improving his grade.
        </p>
            4. The Instructor is the sole authority to determine and give grades to his students.
            5. Every faculty member shall submit his report of grades within ten (10) working
            days, after the final examinations at the end each term.
        </p>
            6. No grade issued by a former faculty member, who at the time of submission is no
            longer employed by the University, shall be honored, except when the cause of
            his separation is permanent total incapacity. In case of death/incapacity where
            the faculty failed to submit the grades, a memorandum shall be issued to the
            faculty who shall be given the authority to give grades. The Vice President for
            Academic Affairs thru the Dean shall issue the memorandum.
        </p>
            7. No faculty member shall change any grade after the report of rating has been
            filed with the Office of the College/School/Center/Institute Head and/or with the
            Office of the Registrar. Where an error in computation has been committed, the
            Instructor may request authority from the Dean concerned, through the
            Department/Coordinator/ Chairman, to make the necessary change. If the
            23
            request is granted, the Dean concerned shall forward the change of rating to the
            office of the Registrar for correction of the records. However, in no case shall
            grades be changed beyond one (1) year after initial filing, nor shall any change
            have operated to the prejudice of the student. Evidence like class records, class
            cards and other pertinent document, and certification from 3 disinterested
            witnesses shall be presented/attached to the request.
        </p>
            8. The grade of INC is given if a student whose class standing throughout the
            semester is passing but fails to take the final examination or fails to complete all
            academic requirements for the course, due to illness or other valid reasons. If the
            reason is deemed justifiable by the Dean or Unit Head, the student may be given
            the examination. If the student passes the examination to remove the ‘INC”, the
            final grade may be “3.0” (2.0 for graduate studies) or better, if he fails, the final
            grade shall be ”5.0”. In case the class standing is not passing, and the student
            fails to take the final examinations for any reason, a grade of “5.0” shall be given.
            “INC” is also given for a work that is of passing quality, some part of which is a
            report/term paper or other requirement, but for good reason, was not fulfilled; the
            final grade may be “3.0” (2.0 for graduate studies)or better if the student complies;
            otherwise, the grade shall be “5.0”.
        </p>
            9. Examination for removal of INC may be taken without fee during:
            a) Regular examination periods; provided, that the subject/course involved
            is included in the schedule of examination; and,
            b) The regular removal examination period, i.e. within the third week after
            the registration in each semester; provided further, that the examination
            is taken at the time it is scheduled.
        </p>
            10. Removal examination may be taken at other times on recommendation of the
            Chairman of the department concerned and approval by the Dean, upon payment
            of an examination fee per subject. A student not in residence shall pay the
            registration fee besides the examination fee in order to be entitled to take the
            removal examination.
        </p>
            11. Completion of the INC shall be the sole responsibility of the student. Only the
            Instructor who gave the INC could issue a completion grade. In justifiable cases,
            however, another instructor handling the same subject as the one involved may
            conduct the removal examination and issue the completion grade, provided, that
            said instructor is duly authorized by the Dean concerned.
        </p>
            12. The period for the removal of a grade of “INC.” should not extend beyond one
            calendar year from the date the mark was received.
        </p>
            13. A grade of “INC.” not removed within the period provided in the preceding section
            shall automatically become “5.0”. Unless there are evidences to the contrary, the
            Registrar is authorized to make the automatic conversion from “INC.” to “5.0”.
        </p>
            14. For unfinished thesis/dissertation / on-the job training /practicum /thesis options,
            a grade of “In Progress” shall be given.
            24
        </p>
            15. Payment of a “Special Examination Fee” shall be required for students completing
            the INC outside of the schedule date, within the prescribed grace period.
        </p>
            16. In case of suspended student, completion of thesis during the period of
            suspension shall not be honored. Re-enrolment may be made later after the
            termination of the suspension.
