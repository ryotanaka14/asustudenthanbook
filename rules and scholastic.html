            <h1>XIII. RULES ON SCHOLASTIC DELINQUENCY</h1>
            <p>The faculty of the University shall promulgate suitable and effective provisions governing
                all delinquent students for all levels.
            </p>
            <h4>Actions on Scholastic Delinquency</h4>
            <p>1. Scholastic delinquencies shall be dealt with in accordance with the following policy
                standards, unless otherwise provided:
            </p>
                a. Warning – Any student who obtains final grades at the end of the semester
                below “3” in 25 percent to 49 percent of the total number of academic units in
                which he/she is registered shall be warned by the Dean to improve his work.
                He/she shall be allowed to enroll a load of not more than three units less than
                the normal load in the ensuing semester.
            </p>
                b. Probation- Any student who obtains final grades at the end of the semester
                below “3” in 50 percent to 75 percent of the total number of academic units in
                which he/she is registered shall be placed on probation for the succeeding
                semester and his/her load shall be limited only to 12 units. Probation may be
                removed by passing with grades of “3” or better in more than 50 percent of the
                units in which the student has final grades in the succeeding semester.
            </p>
                c. Debarred- Any student who obtains final grades at the end of the semester
                below “3” in 76 percent or more of the total number of academic units in which
                he/she receives final grades shall be advised to rest for one (1) year. A student
                debarred for the second time under the rule shall not be eligible for readmission
                to the University.
            </p>
                2. Disqualification to enroll mentioned in the preceding paragraph does not apply to
                cases where grades of “5.0” were due to the student’s unauthorized dropping certified
                by the faculty and Dean concerned. However, if the authorized dropping takes place
                after the mid-semester and the student’s class standing is poor, the grade of”5.0” shall
                be counted against him her. The recommendation of the Director of Office of student
                Affairs and the Dean concerned shall be based on the individual merit of the cases;
                provided that in case of re-admission into the University, the action shall be no lighter
                than “probation”.
            </p>
                3. A grade of “INC” shall not be included in the computation to evaluate scholastic
                standing; when it is replaced with a numerical grade the latter shall be included in the
                grades during the semester when the compliance is made.
            </p>
                4. Units earned by debarred students in other schools during the period of their
                debarment shall not be credited. However, they may enroll in a non-degree program.
            </p>
                5. No application for readmission of any debarred student shall be submitted to the
                President for approval without the favorable recommendation of the Dean concerned.
            </p>
                6. Unless otherwise provided, an undergraduate degree or course must be completed
                within one-and-half times the period prescribed for the same.</p>
