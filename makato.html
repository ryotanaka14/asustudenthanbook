            <h1>Makato Campus</h1>

             <p>The ASU Makato Campus is formerly the Northern Panay Teachersâ€™ College (NPTC)
                located at Barangay Calangcang, Makato, Aklan which was created by virtue of Republic Act No.
                4711 duly approved on June 18, 1966.
             </p>
             <p>
                The college never operationalized, however, and in 1979, the Department of Education
                granted the Aklan Agricultural College a permit to open it as an extension high school.
                As the law creating the school was never repealed, it was reactivated through a resolution
                by League of Municipalities of Aklan headed by Mayor Ramon S. Legaspi, Jr. of Makato, and
                officially opened in School Year 1996-1997.
            </p>
            <p>
                The college was integrated to the Aklan State University and is now known as the Teacher
                Education Center (TEC) under the academic supervision of the School of Arts and Sciences
                (SAS). The ASU Makato Campus has acquired an additional 10 hectares lot located in Barangay
                Castillo, donated by the provincial government of Aklan.
