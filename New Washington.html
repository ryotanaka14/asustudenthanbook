            <h1>New Washington Campus</h1>

             <p>The ASU New Washington Campus started as the New Washington Junior High School
                in 1948 and eventually became the New Washington High School in 1954. Through R.A. 1931
                which was approved in 1957, it became the Aklan National School of Fisheries. The School was
                elevated to Aklan National College of Fisheries (ANCF) through R.A. 3944 in 1964.
                </p>
                <p>
                The school which has an area of 12 hectares is located about 10 kilometers from the
                Dumaguit Wharf and is several meters away from Tambak Beach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon its integration to ASU, ANCF became the ASU-College of Fisheries and Marine
                Sciences (ASU-SFMS).
