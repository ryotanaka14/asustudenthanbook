            <h1>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES/PROVISIONS</h1>
                <h4>Supplementary to offenses/sanctions.</h4>
             <p>1.The SDC or Student Discipline Committee shall have the power to determine whether

            </p>

            </p>
                5. If applicable, students who have been sanctioned or undergone disciplinary action may
                be required to issue a written public apology.
            </p>
                6. Commission of any two major offenses within a semester/term shall place the
                sanctioned student (if applicable) on a Re-admission Probation status for the next
                semester/term.
            </p>
                7. Students who are currently serving major disciplinary sanction and are qualified to
                receive honors/awards (academic, leadership, etc.) shall have the honors/awards
                forfeited/withdrawn/ annulled/rescinded.
            </p>
                8. Upon request of the office concerned, the SDC shall provide the information regarding
                the disciplinary record of the student recipient of awards. 
            </p>
            <h4>Offenses/Sanctions under unusual circumstances.</h4>
            <p>1. Students enrolled in On-the-Job Training (OJT) are subject to the disciplinary process
                based on the approved OJT manual.</p>

                <h4>Consequences to disciplinary actions.</h4>
                <p>1. If warranted and applicable, students who have been sanctioned or undergone
                    disciplinary action shall be required to see the Guidance Counselor immediately.
                </p>
            </p>
                    2. Regardless of the sanction imposed, the student respondent will not be readmitted to
                    class, allowed to take the examination, proceed with the accomplishment of any
                    assignment or enroll without a certification from the SDC that the case has been
                    investigated and that appropriate actions have been taken. The complainant shall be
                    informed by the SDC of pertinent actions taken on the case.
                </p>
                    3. Students who have been sanctioned or undergone disciplinary action shall be allowed to
                    take a special exam only for any major examination missed. </p>
                <h4>Complementary to offenses/sanctions.</h4>
                <p>1. If a disciplinary proceeding (or investigation process) for a certain student accused of any
                    offense may not be immediately pursued by reason of “end of term or semester”, then it
                    shall be held in abeyance until the next term or semester shall have officially commenced,
                    unless otherwise this temporary cessation of disciplinary process may impair the right of the
                    parties to a speedy hearing thereby compromising the ends of justice.
                </p>
            </p>
                    2. Any student found guilty of any offense whose sanction may not be served immediately
                    by reason of “end of term or semester” shall be meted out the disciplinary action the
                    following term or semester which shall begin in the first day of the 2nd week after the first
                    official day of classes, unless otherwise this temporary suspension of sanction
                    implementation may impair the right of the offended party to a speedy and prompt
                    administration of justice.
                </p>
                    3. When sanctions, specifically suspension days, to be imposed to erring students do not
                    have sufficient implementation time for valid reasons, then an equivalent community service
                    may be served. In lieu of the community service, a corresponding extension project of the
                    college where he/she belongs may be rendered. Days of service may be equivalent to the
                    number of days of suspension or prorated depending upon the weight of the project.
                </p>
                    4.Community service may also be allowed to students who are given suspension during
                    summer classes.
                </p>
                    4.1 A student who has been suspended but allowed to render community service is
                    permitted to attend classes.
                </p>
                    4.2 The student’s request for community service shall be signed by both the student
                    and her/his parent or guardian.
                </p>
                    4.3 The letter shall be submitted to the SDC prior to the effectivity of the sanction.
                </p>
                    4.4 The student shall be assigned by the SDC to her/his designated work area.
                </p>
                    4.5 The student is required to submit Community service journal and Certificate of
                    Accomplishment from the office where she/he was assigned.</p>
                    5. If a disciplinary proceeding conducted upon any graduating student accused of any
offense shall extend beyond Graduation Day, the process shall be finished regardless
whether he/she actually graduates or not. If found guilty, and the student has graduated,
the sanction shall be to render community service corresponding to the extension project of
the college where he/she belongs which may be equivalent to the number of days of
suspension or prorated depending upon the weight of the project. If the student did not
graduate but found guilty then the usual procedures for the implementation of sanction shall
be followed. The credentials of the erring student will be released after the suspension/
community service has been served.
            </p>
6. The matter of major offense committed by any student who has just graduated but whose
school credentials have not yet been obtained shall be considered as unusual and the same
shall be forwarded to higher authorities as an administrative case or a criminal offense for
appropriate action. The OSD shall officially recommend that if the said student is found
guilty, and he/she is a recipient of honors/awards (academic, leadership, scholarship, etc.),
then these should be forfeited/withdrawn/ annulled/rescinded.
</p>
In any disciplinary proceeding, settlement between the student respondent and the
complainant may be pursued only if the offense involved is personal such as “acts of
mischief or unjust vexation or provocation to a fight or physical injury” against any individual.
This does not mean that the respondent when found guilty shall not be meted out
disciplinary action. The matter of replacement/restoration and/or restitution/compensation
to properties damaged or persons injured shall be settled.
</p>
In any disciplinary proceeding, if the complainant withdraws the complaint, the OSD or the
Discipline Board reserves the right to pursue the case in the interest of the University and
the University community and the public at large especially if there is a semblance of
coercive pressure from any third party against the complainant.
