            <h1>POLICY ON MAINTAINING THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF STUDENT
                DISCIPLINE RECORDS </h1>

                <p>All referrals to the Student Discipline Committee or SDC are considered student discipline records
                    and are therefore confidential.
                </p>
                </p>
                    Disciplinary records are kept by the Student Disciplinary Committee in the Guidance and
                    Counseling Services Offices (GCSO) and are separate from all other educational records,
                    including academic transcripts. The length of time a disciplinary record is maintained depends
                    on the level of sanction issued, and/or the incidence of any additional violations while the initial
                    record is currently on file. Additional violations(s) may result in file(s) being maintained for an
                    extended period of time.
                </p>
                    Disciplinary records for minor offenses are maintained for at least six (6) years; disciplinary
                    records for major offenses are kept permanently, including those involving as assessed sanction
                    of suspension, expulsion, denial or revocation of a degree, dismissal from as academic
                    program, or withdrawal of a diploma 
                </p>
                <h4>APPLICATION AND EFFECTIVITY </h4>
                <p>In case of conflict between the provisions stated here, especially Offenses and Sanctions, and
                    the provisions of other equally approved student manuals/handbooks/guidebooks/booklets
                    adopted, published, circulated and implemented by other colleges/departments University-wide
                    for college students, the provisions of these guidelines shall prevail.
                </p>
                    </p>
                    Should any section or provision of these guidelines be officially declared invalid or null or void,
                    the other sections or provisions not affected thereby shall remain in full force and effect.
                </p>
                    Mandatory Evaluation and Review. By the end of each academic year, the University shall
                    conduct a mandatory review of the policy as to the status of its implementation and compliance
                    to existing laws and regulations for possible revisions or amendments.
                </p>
                    Any revision of these guidelines shall take effect immediately upon approval by the Board of
                    Regents and shall be effective unless otherwise repealed or amended.
                </p>
