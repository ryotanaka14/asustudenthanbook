            <h1>OFFENSES AND SANCTIONS </h1>
            <p>University rules and regulations on student formation are geared to maintain an orderly, efficient,
                and effective school environment conducive to learning. The following directives of discipline are
                measures which shall be imposed to erring students. 
            </p>
           <h4>A. Minor Offenses</h4>
           <p>These are light violations of rules and regulations that call for sanctions of no entry, written
            warning, written reprimand, one- to two-day suspension, or disciplinary probation. The sanctions
            to be imposed would depend on instances of the act which could be First, Second, or Third. The
            sanction for offenses where there is properties damaged or persons injured
            (physically/emotionally) shall include replacement/restoration and/or restitution/ compensation
            and/or public apology whatever may be decided by the Student Discipline Committee after proper
            determination.
           </p>
        </p>
            As a general rule, any University official, faculty member, co-academic/non-academic staff and
            security personnel may warn or reprimand a misbehaving student. However, care and caution
            should be exercised not to violate the rights of the student.
