                <h1>VIII. STUDENT DRUG TESTING POLICY</h1>
                    <h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
                <p>1. To promote a “drug-free” university and interest of the government in preventing
                    dangerous drug use among the students.
                </p>
            </p>

                    2. Instill in the minds of the students that dangerous drugs not only interfere in their
                    ability to learn but also disrupt the teaching environment.
                </p>
                    3. Strengthen and collaborate efforts with concerned agencies
                    (DDB/PDEA/PNP/DOH/CHED/LGU) against the use of illegal drugs and in the
                    treatment of dangerous drug users and dependents.
                </p>
                    4. Establish a stronger partnership between the University and the students,
                    parents, government agencies and NGOs providing programs and activities
                    intended to facilitate the holistic and well-rounded student development.
                </p>
                    5. Ensure that the drug testing policies of ASU are reasonable and shall not infringe
                    upon the fundamental rights of the students. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Guiding principles: </h4>
                    <p>“Random drug testing for students is considered by the government as entirely a
                        “health” issue and aims to provide appropriate interventions, to those who will be tested
                        positive for dangerous drug use, which will help the student stop further use and/or abuse
                        of the substance.”(DDB BR No. 3 s.2009 Section 2 paragraph 12)</p>
